# Scoreboard Web App
---

This is a web app I am currently building with React. This is the first of hopefully many React apps that I will be building throughout the month of April 2019.

This web app allows users to:
* add players
* remove players
* increase players score
* decrease players score. 

At the top of the scoreboard, I have a header component which contains:
* total number of players
* total score count
* and a timer.

I would also like to mention that this web app was built alongside a course I am currently taking on [TeamTreehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) to get my footing in React and become a React Developer.
